<h1 class="h1 text-center">Delta White Paper</h1>

<h2 class="h2">Introduction</h2>

<p>
  The birth of a decentralized encrypted digital currency called Bitcoin marks
  that human society is gradually moving towards the era of decentralized
  super-sovereign digital currency. It is the aspiration of the people of the
  world that a new digital currency that is fair, safe, value-preserving, fast,
  and green becomes a daily payment currency.
</p>
<p>
  Our mission is to build a digital currency and decentralized application
  platform that allows every ordinary person to freely participate in minting
  and operating.
</p>
<p>
  Our vision is to work with everyone in the world to create a super-sovereign
  digital currency that is fair, secure, fast, green, and inflation-free. We are
  committed to establishing a relatively free peer-to-peer ecosystem and online
  application environment, allowing everyone to participate freely and jointly
  promote the development and application of Delta.
</p>
<br />
<h2 class="h2">1.Brief introduction to the sovereign currency issue</h2>
<p>
  1.1 1.1The sovereign currency issuing country that acts as the world currency
  can obtain huge international seigniorage and international inflation tax
  benefits. This single world currency structure is an unfair structure.
</p>

<p>
  1.2 The prerequisite for the function of international currency payment means
  is the strong credit guarantee of the currency issuing country. However, the
  <q id="tⅰ"
    >Triffin Dilemma <a href="#fⅰ"><sup>ⅰ</sup></a></q
  >
  makes sovereign currency issuing countries face a dilemma. The single world
  currency pattern is an unstable structure.
</p>

<p>
  1.3 The duality of currency value scales determines that only one currency can
  perform the functions of a world currency in the international market. The
  multi-polar world currency structure will lead to friction among
  currency-issuing countries and is detrimental to the peaceful development of
  the world economy.
</p>

<p>
  1.4 centralized currency issuance power in order to stimulate the economy and
  increase fiscal revenue may lead to severe over-issuance of currency and high
  inflation. This will seriously affect the value of the existing currency in
  ordinary people's pockets and increase the economic pressure for survival .
</p>

<h2 class="h2">2.The current status and drawbacks of cryptocurrency</h2>

<blockquote class="blockquote mb-2">
  Bitcoin is the earliest cryptocurrency. The concept was first proposed by
  Satoshi Nakamoto on November 1, 2008, and was officially born on January 3,
  2009. The open source software designed and released based on Satoshi
  Nakamoto's ideas and the P2P network built on it. Bitcoin is a P2P form of
  digital currency. Bitcoin’s transaction records are open and transparent.
  Peer-to-peer transmission means a decentralized payment system. Unlike most
  currencies, Bitcoin is not issued by a specific monetary institution. It is
  generated through a large number of calculations based on a specific algorithm
  . Some encrypted digital currency products subsequently invented by humans
  also basically refer to the model and technology of Bitcoin.
</blockquote>
<p>
  Such models and technical solutions have many excellent benefits and have
  brought many inspirations to the subsequent development of digital currency.
  for example: Decentralization and immutability - these features ensure that
  the funds held by people are not controlled and supervised by any third party,
  while giving people a complete sense of ownership. Holders don’t have to worry
  about their funds being frozen or wiped, which is reassuring. Independence,
  fairness - Cryptocurrencies are not controlled by any country, bank or
  financial institution, and they are based on a decentralized network.
  Theoretically, it avoids to a certain extent the competition and conflicts
  caused by countries pursuing advantages in monetary policies and financial
  systems.
</p>
<p>
  However, it also brings about many practical problems. Related issues will be
  discussed below.
</p>
<h3>2.1 Security</h3>
<p>
  There are two main aspects of cryptocurrency security issues designed based on
  the above principles:
</p>
<ul class="list-decimal">
  <li>
    Private key cracking - The theoretical difficulty of cracking a Bitcoin
    private key is equal to cracking a 256-bit key. In other words, the attacker
    needs to exhaust the problem approximately 10^ 77 times at most. Although
    this chance is very slim, no one can guarantee that a successful collision
    will definitely happen for the last time. At the same time, with the
    emergence and development of quantum computers, it will bring greater
    worries to holders.
  </li>
  <li>
    Private keys are lost or stolen - Keeping the private keys of cryptographic
    currencies is an important problem faced by holders. Regardless of whether
    you choose to use a cold wallet, paper wallet or brain wallet, there is a
    possibility that the private key will be lost or stolen, which makes people
    feel very anxious. Everyone in the world has had something lost or stolen,
    or forgotten important information. Therefore, no one can guarantee that
    this will not happen when it comes to managing private keys or mnemonic
    phrases. The worst part is that once lost or stolen, it cannot be retrieved
    or reset by any means, which brings huge risks to the holder.
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>2.2 Fairness</h3>
<p>
  an example, although its decentralized nature allows anyone to participate in
  verifying transactions and mining blocks, in the early days, only a few people
  devoted themselves to this and thus obtained a large amount of Bitcoins. With
  the rise of the Bitcoin network, a large amount of computing power has been
  concentrated in the hands of a few mining farms, resulting in large-scale
  centralization of Bitcoin production and wealth distribution. Currently, 87%
  of Bitcoins are owned by 1% of the network, making it difficult for most
  ordinary people to get involved. People who want to own Bitcoin in the later
  period can only buy it in the secondary market at high prices or invest huge
  sums of money to purchase computing power. This situation makes it difficult
  for most ordinary people to have the confidence and strength to join.
  Therefore, fairness is an issue worth thinking about in cryptocurrency
  networks such as Bitcoin .
</p>
<h3>2.3 Energy consumption and environmental issues</h3>
<p>
  According to real-time Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index (CBECI) data
  released by the
  <q id="tⅱ"
    >Cambridge Center for Alternative Finance<a href="#fⅱ"><sup>ⅱ</sup></a></q
  >, the energy consumption of global Bitcoin mining is staggering. Currently,
  this figure is approximately 131.73TWh, which is comparable to the annual
  electricity consumption of countries such as Argentina or the Netherlands. In
  addition, Bitcoin mining also produces a large amount of carbon emissions,
  accounting for about 0.10% of total global emissions. This has exacerbated
  global environmental problems, especially climate change and environmental
  pollution.
</p>
<p>
  mining on Bitcoin and similar networks continues to expand, so does energy
  consumption and carbon emissions. However, although the energy consumption and
  carbon emissions of these mining have attracted much attention, it has also
  promoted the development and application of greener and more efficient
  encryption technologies.
</p>
<h3>2.4 POS dilemma</h3>
<p>
  The emergence of the POS (Proof of Stake) mechanism has indeed solved to a
  certain extent the problems of energy consumption and transaction speed of
  cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin. However, there are also some difficulties in
  the POS mechanism. The main problem is that in the POS mechanism, the
  validators with the most staked tokens can obtain verification qualifications
  and receive rewards faster. This mechanism may lead to "the rich getting
  richer and the poor getting poorer", thus raising the issue of distribution
  fairness. This further hinders the circulation and popularity of
  cryptocurrency.
</p>
<p>
  Under the POS mechanism, validators with a large number of tokens are able to
  obtain more rewards, which makes rich validators richer and poor validators
  poorer. This model may exacerbate the gap between the rich and the poor in
  society, reduce the participation of ordinary people, and thus hinder the
  popularity and development of cryptocurrency.
</p>
<p>
  In addition, there are some other problems with the POS mechanism. For
  example, staking tokens can create risks, and validators may suffer losses if
  the price of the token drops. In addition, the verifiers in the POS mechanism
  may be maliciously attacked by attackers, thus affecting the security and
  stability of the entire network.
</p>
<p>
  Therefore, although the POS mechanism solves the problems of energy
  consumption and transaction speed of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin to a
  certain extent, it also brings some new problems and challenges. In order to
  solve these problems, further research and exploration of more fair, secure
  and effective consensus mechanisms are needed.
</p>
<br />
<p>
  <i>
    Of course, in addition to the security, fairness, energy consumption and POS
    issues mentioned above, there are other problems with various existing
    cryptocurrencies. For example, there are problems such as slow transaction
    speed, high transaction costs, large price fluctuations, lack of application
    scenarios, and exchange gaps. These problems will not be discussed here for
    the time being. The subsequent delta design description chapters will
    discuss how to solve and avoid these problems through some effective methods
    and strategies.

<h2>3.Delta is a more ideal digital currency system</h2>
<header class="italic">
  In order to design and develop a more ideal digital currency, we stand on the
  shoulders of our predecessors, learn from their advantages, and avoid making
  the same mistakes. At the same time, combined with the current social
  conditions and technological foundation, we take humanistic currency as the
  basic concept and are committed to designing and building an ideal digital
  currency system in the future society.
</header>
<h3>3.1 Nouns and definitions</h3>
<p>
  written explanations of some necessary terms and definitions at the front.
</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: disclosure-closed">
  <li>
    <b>DTC: </b>This is the abbreviation of Delta Coin and the code for this
    digital currency.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>DTCT: </b>This is the abbreviation of Delta Credit, which means DTC that
    has not been activated and released.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>δ: </b>This is the currency symbol of Delta Coin, such as 10δ, 100δ,
    1000δ,
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Mining: </b>: In the Delta application, through specific allocation rules
    and modes, users obtain the behavior of DTCT through click operations.
  </li>
</ul>

<header>Roles and functions:</header>
<p>
  Roles and functions constitute an organic whole of currency casting, consensus
  building, and system security. In the Delta system, there are three core
  roles: miners, ambassadors, and validators.
</p>

<ul class="list-disc">
  <li>
    <b>Miner: </b>A participant in the Delta system will obtain miner status
    when performing mining operations for the first time. Its main function is
    to conduct mining operations on Delta’s mobile application to generate DTC.
    This design is very interesting and practical because it consumes no
    additional power, is environmentally friendly, and does not cause time
    anxiety or affect personal health. In the construction process of Delta
    Consensus, miners are the main force
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Ambassador: </b>
    Any miner can recommend people around them to join Delta by using their own
    DID (Digital Identity Identifier) and build a micro-community network. Those
    who successfully recommend others to join will automatically receive
    ambassador status. The role of the Ambassador is to teach new members how to
    conduct mining operations and help them understand how Delta works.
    Therefore, ambassadors are a key force in Delta consensus
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Validator: </b> The unique design of the Delta system makes it a digital
    currency system that requires no password, no private key, and no mnemonic
    phrase. In this system, the role of the verifier is to provide account
    authentication services to unspecified users through verification terminals.
    Any miner has the opportunity to become a validator through the election
    process, and they play an important role in ensuring the security of the
    system .
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>3.2 Mobile phone mining</h3>
<p>
  Introducing the concept of mining into cryptocurrency can help solve the
  problem of distribution fairness in currency issuance.<q id="tⅲ"
    >Pi Network<a href="#fⅲ"><sup>ⅲ</sup></a></q
  >
  pioneered the innovative design of mobile mining, which is environmentally
  friendly and effectively avoids energy consumption issues without occupying
  the computing power of the device and additional networks. Today, when mobile
  phones are highly popular, it has become possible for ordinary people to
  participate in digital currency mining. Delta inherited this design. It should
  be noted that the essence of mining lies in distribution, not calculation. In
  the design of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto used the computing power of
  participants to calculate mathematical problems to compete for accounting
  rights and reward Bitcoins. It can be seen that computing power is only used
  in the game to compete for accounting rights, and it is not directly related
  to accounting. Judging from the working principle of the computer, it is just
  the process of writing data to the disk, and this process consumes very little
  energy. Therefore, abandoning computing power mining is completely reasonable
  and feasible under the current technical background.
</p>
<h3>3.3 Proof of People（POP）</h3>
<p>
  If we use the amount of computer work computing power to prove the
  contribution to the network is called POW mining (Proof of Work), and the
  amount of pledged currency to prove the contribution to the network is called
  POS mining (Proof of Stake), then we can Proving the contribution to the
  network through the authenticity of the people themselves is called POP mining
  (Proof of People). When we enable the Delta program on the mobile phone for
  mining, it is not the mobile phone itself that is performing the mining
  process, but the mobile phone as a carrier used to verify the authenticity of
  the individual. Therefore, the essence of Delta is to hand over the power of
  minting money to the people, which is a concept of humanistic currency.
</p>
<h3>3.4 3-No-Verification</h3>
<header>
  The creative design makes Delta an encryption currency system that requires no
  password or
</header>
<p>
  assing 3-No-Verification is the only way for users to enter the Delta system.
  In order to solve the cryptocurrency security issues mentioned in Chapter 2.1,
  we propose and use 3-No-Verification in the Delta account authentication
  design. The meaning is:
</p>
<ul class="list-disc">
  <li>No password</li>
  <li>No private key</li>
  <li>No mnemonic words</li>
</ul>
<p>
  The reason why we do not need passwords, private keys, and mnemonics is that
  if the system is still designed in the form of account + password, password
  protection will be required via email or SMS, which will lead to
  decentralization and service continuity. seriously questioned. Specifically,
  email authentication requires a dedicated outbox address, and SMS verification
  requires an SMS access number or sending port applied for at a
  telecommunications company. Not only do these resources require ongoing
  maintenance, they also require payment. These tasks need to be performed by
  centralized human operations, which will lead to user distrust and is contrary
  to the core concept of decentralized applications.
</p>
<p>
  After the birth of Bitcoin, asymmetric private keys were used as a means of
  authority authentication, which is a completely decentralized authentication
  scheme. Later, in order to facilitate users' memory and management, developers
  derived mnemonic solutions and were widely used in decentralized applications.
  However, these solutions all involve the risk of losing, forgetting, or
  stealing the private key or mnemonic phrase, and cause users a certain amount
  of anxiety. Therefore, we need a more secure and convenient authentication
  method to replace traditional passwords, private keys and mnemonic phrases.
</p>
<p>
  Since passwords, private keys, and mnemonic phrases are at risk of being
  cracked, lost, and forgotten, it is not impossible to abandon these three
  verification methods to achieve decentralized account verification. Delta has
  successfully achieved three-no verification, which is mainly due to the
  powerful functions of the blockchain-based Internet Computer and the world's
  highly mature mobile communication network. MSISDN is the only number that can
  identify mobile users in the mobile communication network, so three-no
  verification is also called decentralized SMS authentication. Delta developers
  have designed a "Decentralized SMS Authentication Protocol" framework, which
  is a completely reliable and decentralized solution. The technical background
  and more detailed description of Internet Computer will be introduced in the
  subsequent technical solution chapters.
</p>

<p>
  <b>3.3.1 Verification process and rules, </b>
  An overview of the verification process and rules is as follows: First, we
  allow users who meet specific conditions to apply for verification terminal
  permissions to become verifiers. Verifiers can use their idle MSISDN (mobile
  phone number) and smartphone to download and install the delta verification
  application. Use the MSISDN as the access number to receive and forward the
  verification string. The verifier only needs to ensure that the mobile phone
  power and network connection are stable, and the verification process will be
  completely automated by the Delta system. When a large number of users apply
  and become verifiers, a verification terminal pool will be formed. Later, when
  a user performs operations that require identity verification such as
  registration, login, or transfer, the Delta system will generate a
  verification string. The user will select a well-functioning terminal from the
  verification terminal pool and send the verification string to the terminal's
  access number in the form of a text message. After receiving the verification
  string, the verification terminal extracts the sender number at the same time
  and then forwards it to the Delta system. Finally, the Delta system performs a
  verification comparison and the legitimate user's request will be allowed to
  pass. For more detailed information, see the
  <q id="tⅳ">
    Decentralized SMS Verification Protocol <a href="#fⅳ"><sup>ⅳ</sup></a></q
  >
  Framework.
</p>
<p>
  In addition, additional explanations are needed: First, in the early stage
  when the system has not yet formed enough verification terminals, developers
  will access a globally accepted virtual access number to provide early users
  with verification access. This virtual access number will be removed once the
  number of validators is sufficient to meet basic needs. Second, in order to
  avoid users incurring higher international SMS charges, the system will
  prioritize the home country verification access number for users who need
  verification.
</p>
<header>Chart 1 ( Illustration of verification principle )</header>
<img src="/img/whitepaper1.png" />
<p>
  <b>3.3.2 For the verifier rules part, </b>our design includes the following
  items:
</p>
<ul style="list-style-type: lower-alpha">
  <li>
    Number rule: The upper limit of the number of validators in each region
    (divided by
    <q id="tⅴ"
      >E.164<a href="#fⅴ"><sup>ⅴ</sup></a></q
    >
    country code) is 1/10,000 of the total registered population, and the
    minimum number of validators is 1,000.
  </li>
  <li>
    taking election: To become a validator, you must pass the staking election.
    Candidates need to invest a certain amount of Delta Coin into the campaign
    pool and download the Delta verification terminal to ensure a normal
    connection with the Delta system. According to the election rules, the
    system will automatically select a certain number of winners from the
    election pool to become validators in each election cycle (one day). A
    maximum of 30 people will be selected in each cycle. At the same time, the
    total number of people screened cannot exceed the upper limit specified by
    the region. Successful validators will receive a 90-day working
  </li>
  <li>
    Offline slashing: Within the working cycle (90 days), the verifier must not
    be offline for more than 1 hour for any reason, otherwise its pledged funds
    will be slashed and transferred back to the community mining fund pool.
  </li>
  <li>
    Attack penalty: For verifiers who attempt to gain access to others through
    attacks (such as packet capture, tampering, etc.), the system will
    confiscate their pledged funds and mark them as dishonest users
  </li>
  <li>
    Election renewal: After the 90-day work period expires, validators can
    choose to continue participating in the staking election to maintain
    verification services. The pledge amount can be calculated superimposed on
    the amount in the current service period.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  In addition, a reward mechanism is provided for honest verifiers, and detailed
  measures regarding rewards will be elaborated in the economic model section.
</p>
<h3>3.5 Safety Circle</h3>
<p>
  After the introduction of the 3-No Authentication security verification model,
  the use and management of digital assets will become safer and more
  convenient. However, under special circumstances, this single verification
  mechanism may lose its security. For example, when a mobile device is lost or
  stolen by others, the other party may have full control of the device,
  including sending verification SMS messages. In order to prevent this from
  happening and protect the security of account assets, we have added a security
  circle function to the system design to provide secondary identity
  verification for accounts to enhance account security.
</p>
<p>
  The security circle is a verification model based on user social
  relationships, and this function is completely decentralized. It helps users
  achieve security verification through their social relationship circle. The
  security circle function can effectively increase the difficulty of malicious
  attacks and reduce the risk of accounts being obtained by others.
</p>
<p>
  The working principle of the safety circle is as follows: First, users can add
  trusted people (usually relatives and friends) to their safety circle member
  list, usually 3-5 people. When an account requires security circle
  verification, the Delta smart contract program will randomly select a member
  from the security circle member list to assist the current user in confirming
  their identity by providing a security code. When the current user asks the
  member for the security code, the selected security circle member will be able
  to help confirm whether the user is the user. At the same time, the program
  will prompt: "Refuse to provide the security code if it is not a relative or
  friend" to protect the security of the account. Therefore, any Delta user
  should ensure that the people on their security circle member list are
  trustworthy.
</p>
<header>
  Under what circumstances is it necessary to use a safety circle ?
</header>
<ul class="list-decimal">
  <li>
    When a user’s mobile phone with the Delta program installed is lost, the
    user should use a new device to forcefully log in to the Delta application.
    In this case, users need to use security circle verification to ensure the
    security of their account. Due to the loss of the phone, the original
    verification status has become invalid, and the user needs help from
    security circle members to verify their identity and log in to the app.
  </li>
  <li>
    When the account performs sensitive operations, such as changing mobile
    phone numbers or updating security circle members, in order to prevent these
    operations from being performed by others, security circle verification also
    needs to be enabled .
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>3.6 Economic model</h3>
<p>
  In Chapter 2.2, we mentioned fairness issues in the distribution of existing
  cryptocurrencies. Therefore, the design of delta distribution rules needs to
  avoid a distribution method similar to Bitcoin, that is, allocate most of the
  currency to early participants. This distribution method may result in
  late-stage participants needing to purchase at a high price, thus turning it
  into a speculative tool. This not only hinders the formation of human currency
  consensus, but may also lead to the failure to realize circulation value.
  Therefore, the delta allocation rule needs to be implemented in a more
  reasonable way.
</p>
<p>
  First of all, we define the initial total amount of Delta Coin as 300 billion.
  Compared with other cryptocurrencies, Delta uses such a large total amount to
  facilitate circulation and use in daily life. (For example, we want to price a
  250ml carton of milk at 0.3δ, but not 0.0000003δ so too many zeros after the
  decimal point would be confusing)
</p>
<header>
  Then, we divide these 300 billion coins into four parts, each part plays a
  different role:
</header>
<ul style="list-style-type: disclosure-closed">
  <li>Part 1: Community Mining - 60%</li>
  <li>
    Part 2: Consensus expansion fund (for ambassador recommendation, new
    registration and validator rewards) - 10%
  </li>
  <li>Part 3: Ecological Construction Incentive Fund - 20%</li>
  <li>Part 4: ICP Fuel Crowdfunding – 10%</li>
</ul>
<header>(Distribution ratio chart)</header>
<img src="/img/whitepaper2.png" />
<aside>
  The purpose of dividing the currency amount into multiple parts for
  distribution is to simultaneously promote the development of community
  consensus and ecological construction, and to stimulate the enthusiasm of the
  community in the initial 11 ecological construction and ensure the reliability
  of long-term system operation.
</aside>

<header>Some additional notes on the allocation scheme are as follows:</header>
<ul class="list-decimal">
  <li>
    The initial total and the current distribution plan are executed under an
    "interim governance mode". Obviously these aggregates are not enough to
    serve as a global consensus currency. Afterwards, under the DAO model, the
    "Governance Committee", which can be elected by all Delta members, can
    discuss and propose additional issuance proposals based on development
    needs.
  </li>
  <li>
    All of them can become tradable DTC later . This 300 billion is the total
    amount of Delta Credit (DTCT), which represents the effective amount before
    activation and release through KYC. After KYC screening, generally speaking,
    the final number of DTC that can be circulated will usually be smaller than
    DTCT.
  </li>
  <li>
    Delta is based on the concept of human currency. In theory, all coins should
    be distributed through community mining and consensus expansion, while other
    parts should be raised through donations or handling fees. However, in the
    early stages of the project, the demand and workload for ecological
    construction were very large. In order to ensure the success of the project
    and give ecological builders more confidence, we implemented reserved
    allocation. The fuel crowdfunding part is also to provide a more reliable
    operating mechanism.
  </li>
</ul>
<h4>3.6.1 Community Mining</h4>
<p>
  The total amount of community mining is 180 billion, which is equal to 60% of
  the total amount of 300 billion. We allocate these coins through live users’
  daily check-in and contribution of attention. In this way, consensus can be
  formed after a long period of time. The principle is that users convert
  invisible virtual numbers into currency consensus by contributing attention,
  and this consensus in turn promotes its value as currency. In terms of the
  basic mining rate, in order to find a balance between early incentives and
  long-term fairness, we adopted a two-stage doubling scheme design.
</p>
<p>
  The first stage: When the number of participants is between 1 and 30 million,
  the rate between 1 and 3,000 people is 32δ/day, which is used as the starting
  benchmark. Whenever the number of people increases by 10 times, the rate is
  halved until the number of participants reaches 30 million, when the rate
  drops to 2δ/day and then enters
</p>
<p>
  Second stage: When the number of participants reaches 30 million or more,
  every time the number of participants increases three times, the basic rate
  will be halved until the final mining is completed
</p>
<figure>
  <aside>Chart 3, (Basic rate halving chart analysis )</aside>
  <img src="/img/whitepaper3.png" alt="Basic rate halving chart analysis" />
</figure>
<h4>3.6.2 Registration and recommendation rewards</h4>
<p>
  In order to promote the faster development of Delta Network, we have specially
  set up a referral reward program. After becoming a miner, anyone can become a
  promotion ambassador and earn these rewards by recommending others.
</p>
<ul class="list-disc">
  <li>
    ixed rewards for referrals: In order to invite friends and family to join
    Delta, recommenders only need to share their digital DID via a QR code or
    link. When the other party fills in the recommender's digital DID when
    registering, both parties will receive a 1δ reward. If the referral
    registration occurs after community mining has stopped, the reward will be
    halved, with each receiving 0.5 δ . This part of the reward will be
    distributed from the total amount of 30 billion "Consensus Expansion Fund".
  </li>
  <li>
    Direct recommendation reward: Every time an ambassador directly recommends
    someone, when the recommended person is in mining status, the mining rate
    will be increased by 1/3 of the base rate. In addition, when the
    ambassador's superior recommender is in mining status, this ratio will also
    be calculated into the direct recommendation reward.
  </li>
  <p>
    Assuming that the current basic rate is 16δ/day， the number of people
    recommended by the ambassador is n, and they are in mining status, then the
    calculation formula for this part of the day's improvement income is as
    follows: $i 16 \times \frac{1}{3} \times (n+1) = x (δ/day) $i
  </p>
  <li>
    Indirect recommendation rewards: Recommending ambassadors directly recommend
    everyone in the team and everyone they recommend represents the ambassador ’
    s indirect recommended users. When an indirectly recommended user is in
    mining status, the recommending ambassador's mining rate will be increased
    by an additional 1/10 of the base rate.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Assuming that the basic rate is the same as above, and the number of people
  indirectly 13 recommended and mining is n<sub>2</sub>， then the calculation
  formula for this part of the day's improvement income is as follows: $i 16
  \times \frac{1}{10} \times n_2 = x (δ/day) $i。The two parts of rewards,
  direct recommendation and indirect recommendation, will be calculated
  superimposed and allocated among the total community mining funds of 180
  billion.
</p>

<h4>3.6.3 Validator Rewards</h4>
<p>
  Chapter 3.4 explains the basic principles and processes of three-no
  verification. In order to implement such a verification process, the system
  needs some users to apply to become verifiers. At the same time, we also need
  to design certain rewards to motivate these people who pay for it. The reward
  method and amount of validators are divided into two situations.
</p>
<p>
  ①　First, when 10% of the consensus expansion fund has not been used up, the
  validator’s rewards will be paid using this part of the fund. The specific
  amount of the reward for each completed verification is 1/3 of the current
  mining base rate.
</p>
<p>
  ②　In addition, when the consensus expansion fund has been exhausted, the
  verification fee will be paid by the user who needs to verify, and this fee
  will be automatically deducted after the verification process is completed .
  At this time, the verification fee will be calculated as three times the daily
  transfer fee .
</p>
<h4>3.6.4 Ecological Construction Incentive Fund</h4>
<p>
  In order to promote the multi-faceted construction and development of Delta
  Ecology, the fund will be oriented towards multiple incentive programs in
  ecological construction, including:
</p>
<ul class="list-decimal">
  <li>
    Ecological dApp developer reward program: designed to encourage early
    ecological development, contributions to the Delta ecosystem, and
    high-quality ecological project developers. Please refer to the dApp Square
    chapter for more details.
  </li>
  <li>
    Image and visibility promotion award plan: designed to reward individuals or
    teams that have made special contributions to Delta’s image and visibility
    promotion.
  </li>
  <li>
    Early transaction reward program: used to reward users who participate in
    various early transactions in the Delta application.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  In the early "interim governance model", the fund was hosted and planned by
  the Delta core team. Its goal is to promote the prosperity and development of
  all aspects of Delta's ecological construction. Specific uses and rules will
  be designed and adjusted based on actual needs and clearly stated in the
</p>
<p>
  Afterwards, once the "DAO governance mode" is entered, the core team will
  transfer the remaining funds to the DAO for custody. Subsequent usage
  decisions will be
</p>
<h4>3.6.5 ICP Fuel Crowdfunding</h4>
<p>
  How funds are allocated in this regard will be explained in the Fuel Mechanism
  chapter.
</p>
<h4>3.6.6 Handling fee</h4>
<p>
  One of the benefits of generating a certain handling fee during transactions
  is to prevent malicious small-amount transfers from generating a large amount
  of junk accounting data to protect the healthy operation of the Delta system.
  In addition, the handling fees of the Delta system will adopt the burning
  mode, and the handling fees consumed by transactions will be directly
  transferred
</p>
<p>
  Under the "interim governance model", the handling fee burned for each
  transaction is 1‰, while the minimum limit is 0.01δ and the maximum is 0.3δ.
  Under this model, in order to ensure that power is not abused, new coins are
  not allowed to be issued for any reason, which is equivalent to a deflationary
  mechanism in this model.
</p>
<p>
  Later, under the "DAO governance model", DAO can implement an additional
  issuance mechanism through proposals based on actual needs. The additional
  currency can make up for the burning part of the handling fee and prevent
  further deflation. The first part of the additional currency will be used to
  pay for the fuel ”cycles” Delta runs. Other parts can be used for governance
  participation reward funds and other matters that are conducive to
  ecologically sound development. In addition, under the long-term DAO
  governance model, the specific quota or rules of transaction procedures can be
  re-determined through annual proposals.
</p>
<h3>3.7 KYC verification</h3>
<p>
  KYC (Know Your Customer/Client) verification is an important process designed
  to confirm the identity of the user and prevent the creation of fake accounts.
  In the Delta system, since its mining mechanism is based on social networks
  and completely decentralized, KYC verification is particularly important. In
  order to ensure fair distribution and eliminate false identity mining, we plan
  to use a combination of AI identification and community KYC markets. Users can
  achieve anonymous cross-certification of community members through the KYC
  market, and set up a certain reward and penalty mechanism. These measures will
  ensure the fairness and ecological healthy development of the Delta system,
  while increasing users' trust and participation in the system.
</p>
<p>
  First, AI recognition technology can be used in the identity verification
  process to automatically identify and compare identity documents provided by
  users through deep learning and image recognition technology. This can greatly
  improve the efficiency and accuracy of identity verification and reduce human
  error and fraud.
</p>
<p>
  Secondly, the community KYC market is a market mechanism based on the idea of
  decentralization. It prevents behaviors such as "human skin masks" and
  "digital face-changing" through human inspection and judgment, which can
  effectively prevent the occurrence of fraud and attacks against AI. Users can
  achieve anonymous cross-authentication and confirmation of community members
  through this market . In the community KYC market, users can publish their
  identity certification information, and a certain reward and punishment
  mechanism is set up to encourage other users to verify and cross-certify. In
  this way, we can establish a mechanism of mutual supervision and trust to
  ensure the authenticity and credibility of each account.
</p>
<p>
  At the same time, during the manual inspection and certification process in
  the KYC market, we adopt a selective disclosure approach. In authentication,
  selective disclosure refers to the process of verifying the authenticity of an
  individual by showing only the necessary information required for verification
  to the verifier while ensuring that personal information is not leaked . The
  advantage of using this method is that the necessary information can be
  effectively verified while ensuring that the privacy of the person being
  verified is not leaked . Delta uses a fragmented distributed storage method
  when processing personal information, which provides a technical basis for
  selective disclosure of identity authentication.
</p>
<p>
  In addition, in order to prevent malicious behavior and the creation of false
  accounts, the Delta system will also establish a strict supervision mechanism.
  If suspicious behavior or illegal operations are discovered, the system will
  immediately take corresponding measures, such as suspending or marking
  relevant accounts to prevent the process from continuing.
</p>
<p>
  Through the above measures, the Delta system can effectively prevent the
  creation of false accounts and malicious behaviors, ensuring the fairness and
  reliability of the system. At the same time, KYC verification can also
  increase users’ trust and participation in the Delta system and promote the
  healthy development of the Delta ecosystem.
</p>
<p>
  Afterwards, when the user obtains KYC certification, the system will
  immediately release the first DTC for the user. For specific release rules,
  please refer to Chapter 3.12
</p>
<h3>3.8 Non-KYC accounts</h3>
<p>
  In the Delta system, no one has the authority to delete or freeze any account. Because, when the Delta program was written in the early days, such functions or interfaces were not designed, which is more in line with the concept of decentralization and user autonomy. Therefore, non-KYC accounts are allowed to exist in the system for a long time and can participate in transactions or interactions. However, accounts that have passed KYC certification will receive specific marks, and accounts that are not marked with KYC will be restricted from certain rights, such as participating in the DTCT fund release action, becoming a transaction seller, etc. Since unmarked KYC may be regarded as untrustworthy, it may be rejected by some system ecological sub-applications or counterparties.
</p>
<h3>3.9 Fuel mechanism</h3>
<p>
  First, all computer programs require electricity and hardware costs to run.
  For example, for traditional Web2 programs, you need to host the service on a
  platform such as Amazon AWS and pay for resource usage. Blockchain is no
  exception. Bitcoin miners need to purchase expensive ASIC mining machines and
  pay high electricity bills. Their operating costs are fed back to the miners
  in the form of mining rewards and transfer fees. Therefore, transfer fees for
  cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are quite expensive. Other POS model blockchains
  have reduced the cost of mining (game-like computing power calculation), so
  the transfer fees have also dropped relatively, but the governance costs of
  this model are still high, and the final handling fees are still high.
</p>

<p>
  Delta also has running costs. Delta runs entirely within the Internet Computer
  Cypherspace developed by Dfinity. The architectural design of Internet
  computers is more advanced than traditional blockchains and has lower
  operating costs. According to official data, storage costs are approximately
  US$5/GB/year, and Internet computers are not billed in sovereign currency.
  Instead, it requires a
  <q id="tⅵ">
    fuel called "cycles" to power computational operations and storage
    <a href="#fⅵ"><sup>ⅵ</sup></a></q
  >. Such "cycles" are generated through the conversion of Internet Computer
  (ICP) utility tokens. Therefore, Delta needs ICP, a utility token, as its
  operating cost.
</p>
<p>
  Therefore, Delta needs a fuel mechanism to ensure the long-term operation of
  its program. Based on the development of Delta, we divide the fuel source into
  3 stages, namely the startup stage, the consensus building stage and the
  consensus formation stage.
</p>
<p>
  ① Startup phase - in the early stage of Delta deployment to no users, the core
  developers will inject 30 ICP tokens into the Internet Computer smart tank at
  one time (the smart tank will be explained in detail in the running
  environment chapter) to ensure the normal operation of the program, and
  provide service guarantees for users who are about to join.
</p>
<p>
  ② The consensus building stage - refers to the stage from the start of
  operation to before the circulation value is generated. At this stage, we
  launch an "ICP fuel crowdfunding" sub-program in Delta's application square to
  raise the "cycles" of fuel needed for Delta's operation. Any user can raise
  the ICP tokens needed to convert "cycles" fuel for Delta through this
  subroutine, and the program will award the corresponding amount of Delta
  Credit to participants as a bonus for their support based on the set
  algorithm. These rewardable ICP tokens are the fourth part of the total
  distribution (ICP fuel crowdfunding), totaling 30 billion δ. Crowdfunding will
  automatically stop after all distributions are completed. All crowdfunded ICP
  tokens will be stored in a virtual DID that is not bound to the MSISDN
  (meaning that no one has the authority to operate this virtual DID). The Delta
  Fuel Management Program will automatically monitor the "cycles" balance in the
  smart tank. When "cycles" is less than 3000 billion, 10 of the ICP in the
  virtual account will be automatically exchanged for cycles. The calculation
  result of the crowdfunding exchange rate is mainly determined by the two
  parameters of the total number of users and the amount issued. The specific
  algorithm formula is as follows:
</p>
<ul style="margin-left: 4rem">
  <li class="-ml-2">definition:</li>
  <li>$i R =$i number of registrations</li>
  <li>$i D =$i Amount of Delta Credit issued</li>
  <li>$i Ex\_rate =$i current crowdfunding exchange rate</li>
  <li>$i Ex\_rate = \frac{log(D)}{3} \times log(R) \times 0.00003 $i</li>
  <li>Where 3, 0.00003 is a fixed constant.</li>
  <li>
    Assume that the current registered amount R = 100,000, and the crowdfunding
    reward amount D = 330,000,
  </li>
  <li>Then, the current exchange rate is calculated as follows:</li>
  <li>
    $i Ex\_rate = \frac{log(330000)}{3} \times log(100000) \times 0.00003 $i
  </li>
  <li>$i Ex\_rate ≈ 0.001463 $i</li>
  <li>
    That is, currently: 1 ICP can be exchanged for $i 1 \div 0.001463 = 684$iδ
    (The result is rounded to an integer)
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  ③ Consensus formation stage - refers to the completion of large-scale KYC
  verification and entering the "DAO governance mode". DAO can issue a certain
  amount of Delta Coin according to the additional issuance proposal to make up
  for the burning of transaction fees, and give priority to part of the
  additional issuance amount for exchange. Fuel "cycles".
</p>

<h3>3.10 dApp Square</h3>
<p>
  dApp Square is Delta's decentralized application market, a platform for
  Delta's online ecological construction, and a future-oriented Web3 application
  center. Any user with development capabilities can develop Delta applications
  and settle in. After extensive community discussion and voting, the "Delta
  Application Ecosystem White Paper" will be drafted and released. The white
  paper will determine the design and specifications for developer reward
  policies, ethical behavior, user privacy and user data autonomy policies.
</p>
<h3>3.11 USDT dual currency mining</h3>
<p>
  <q id="tⅶ"
    >USDT<a href="#fⅶ"><sup>ⅶ</sup></a></q
  >
  dual-currency mining means the simultaneous mining of two digital currencies,
  DTC and USDT.
</p>
<p>
  Its purpose is to provide miners with a certain amount of effective income in
  the early stages when the Delta ecosystem has not yet formed and prospered; at
  the same time, it also provides developers with certain financial support to
  ensure that developers can continue to provide development services in the
  long term, and ultimately realize Delta Planning and vision; it also provides
  an effective promotion channel for advertisers to promote the positive
  development of consensus.
</p>
<p>
  The principle is to use the large user base of the Delta community to monetize
  traffic and provide multiple benefits to advertisers, Delta core developers
  and miners.
</p>
<p>
  The method is to connect to the existing mature advertising platform. Users
  can display incentive advertisements and obtain monetization benefits through
  a "play button" of the USCT mining module.
</p>
<p>
  Details such as the allocation mechanism and settlement cycle can be found on
  the Delta App "USCT Mining Module" page.
</p>
<h3>3.12 Activation and release mechanism</h3>
<p>
  After the emergence of Ethereum smart contracts, a variety of tokens have been
  issued in the market. Most of the issuances of these tokens have release
  activation mechanisms. Their method generally requires users to promise (or
  stipulate) to use the tokens in a certain proportion and a certain amount. The
  tokens are pledged according to the time period, and then released one or more
  times according to the pledge period. The released tokens can obtain the
</p>
<p>
  The purpose of this design is to ensure the stability and upward price of
  tokens and prevent the value of tokens from collapsing due to large-scale
  selling. The principle is to obtain the development of ecology and consensus
  through the extension of time. This is indeed helpful to early consensus
  building and price stabilization, but its effect is not strong. Because doing
  so will form a large number of zombie users in the system. These zombie users
  do nothing but wait for the time to come and the price to skyrocket. This
  situation will not be helpful to the long-term construction of the consensus
  ecosystem.
</p>
<p>
  To this end, Delta has redefined the release mechanism. We combine the cycle
  with community behavior, that is, within a set cycle and meeting certain
  behavioral conditions, DTC will be released. We call this release mechanism
  behavioral cycle release.
</p>
<p>
  Our specific design plan is as follows: Set the release of account DTC to 100
  cycles, each cycle is at least 7 days, and each cycle is released in equal
  amounts, with a total of 100 releases completed. After the account completes
  the corresponding barter behavior within a cycle, it can obtain the right to
  release.
</p>
<p>
  Specifically, first, before large-scale KYC, we will build a "flea market"
  application in the dApp square. The application allows any Delta user to post
  and buy and sell idle items on it. Trading activities on this application will
  be organically integrated with the DTC release program. When a user purchases
  or sells on the "Flea Market" application, the behavior will be automatically
  transmitted to the DTC release program. Buying and selling behavior that
  complies with the rules will immediately trigger the release mechanism and
  complete the due DTC release within the cycle.
</p>
<p>
  The first DTC release will be performed immediately after the user completes
  KYC, and 1/100 of the total amount will be released. After that, every 7 days,
  if the user has a valid transaction on the "Flea Market" application, the
  release of DTC will be triggered. The release amount in each cycle is 1/99,
  1/98, and 1/97 of the total amount, until the last 1/1 is released.
</p>
<p>
  At the same time, the condition that effective behavior needs to meet is that
  one-way buying or selling cannot be carried out for a long time. In the
  program design, there is a maximum of 3 consecutive one-way behaviors. After
  exceeding the limit, the amount of the current period will not be released
  until the transaction direction is changed and restored.
</p>
<p>
  In terms of periodicity, in the actual program design, we judge that a maximum
  of two times within 14 consecutive days are effective release actions. Doing
  so helps users schedule their transactions flexibly. In addition to releasable
  transaction behaviors, users can participate in more transaction behaviors,
  which is completely free and contributes to better consensus building.
</p>
<h3>3.13 DID digital identity</h3>
<p>
  When a user enters the Delta application through three-no verification, the
  system will generate a globally unique 13-digit string for the user as a
  digital identity DID (decentralized identifier). As a digital identity DID not
  only carries personal information and credit value, and can manage, receive
  and send assets. Combined with the implementation of KYC, a unique, authentic
  and trustworthy binding relationship is formed between the user and the DID
  digital identity.
</p>
<p>
  In the future, it will be possible for users to authorize and manage other
  third-party applications or digital twins in the metaverse through Delta
  digital identity DID.
</p>
<h3>3.14 Privacy protection and traceability</h3>
<p>
  If an individual's financial status is fully disclosed in the transaction
  ledger, it may cause uneasiness, anxiety or embarrassment. Regardless of how
  much or how little wealth one has, exposing one's financial status may have a
  negative impact on the individual. Therefore, the right to protect personal
  privacy cannot be ignored.
</p>
<p>
  At the same time, traceability plays an active role in improving data security
  and trust. The openness, transparency and traceability of transaction data
  increase people's trust and security in assets, so that people do not have to
  worry about data being tampered with or operating in secret.
</p>
<p>
  Therefore, privacy protection and traceability are equally important. We need
  a reasonable approach to resolve these two seemingly conflicting issues. Delta
  adopts the design of separation of accounting address and DID digital
  identity, and the one-way association of DID digital identity and accounting
  address to solve this problem. The accounting address uses an 18 to 19-bits
  cryptographic address based on Base58 encoding, which is a variant of the
  Bitcoin address algorithm. Its purpose is to make it easier for people to
  distinguish it from Bitcoin addresses and to save storage resources. In this
  way, all funds and transactions are recorded at the accounting address. Anyone
  can view and track transactions through the Delta browser, but they cannot
  find the DID digital identity corresponding to the accounting address.
  Multiple accounting addresses can be created under one DID digital identity
  (in order to prevent abuse, when more than one address is created under one
  DID digital identity, a transaction fee will be incurred for each address
  created), and a default payment can be set. address. Users can use any address
  to collect money, and they can also directly use DID digital identity or
  mobile phone number to collect money. The amount received using DID or mobile
  phone number will be automatically transferred to the default address. In this
  way, users can choose between privacy and convenience based on usage
  scenarios.
</p>
<h3>3.15 Decentralized multi-chain wallet</h3>
<p>
  The decentralized multi-chain wallet is one of the core features built into
  the Delta system. Delta multi-chain wallet makes it possible for users to
  transfer assets, communicate information and collaborate with other
  blockchains. It can easily receive and send other public chain assets. When
  users manage these assets, they do not require any private keys, mnemonic
  words or passwords at all. This convenient, easy-to-use and secure feature is
  mainly due to Delta's three-no verification protocol and Internet
  Computer-based ECDSA threshold signatures (Threshold ECDSA signatures)
  technology. ECDSA threshold signature technology allows people to create
  addresses on third-party blockchains and perform transfers without possessing
  private keys. This makes assets hosted in the Delta multi-chain wallet
  extremely safe and trustworthy.
</p>
<q class="blockquote mb-2">
  The Internet Computer implements a novel threshold ECDSA protocol as part of
  its chain-key signatures toolbox. In this protocol, the private ECDSA key
  exists only as secret shares held by designated parties, namely the replicas
  of a threshold-ECDSA-enabled subnet on the IC, and signatures are computed
  using those secret shares without the private key ever being reconstructed.
  Each replica of such subnet holds a key share that provides no information on
  its own (in fact, any set of shares up to a threshold of one third cannot be
  distinguished from a set of random strings). At least one third of the
  replicas are required to generate a threshold signature using their respective
  key shares. Besides the actual threshold signing protocol, chain-key ECDSA
  also comprises protocols for secure key distributed key generation and
  periodic key resharing, which are crucial parts of the protocol. This makes
  chain-key ECDSA signatures much more powerful than any off-the-shelf threshold
  ECDSA protocol.
</q>
<br />
<q class="blockquote mb-2" id="tⅷ">
  Each canister on any subnet of the Internet Computer has control over a unique
  ECDSA public key and can request signatures for this public key to be
  computed. A signature is only issued to the eligible canister, i.e., the
  legitimate holder of this ECDSA key. Each canister can obtain signatures only
  for its own ECDSA keys. Note that canisters do not hold any private ECDSA keys
  or key shares themselves. Threshold cryptography can help enable functionality
  in the trust model of a blockchain that would be impossible to achieve with
  conventional cryptography alone

<h3>3.16 Technical solutions and implementation</h3>
<p>
  Delta chose Internet Computer (IC) as the basic operating environment and used
  the Motoko programming language to implement its server-side coding. The
  complete and complex functions of the Delta system are realized thanks to the
  powerful programmability and high-speed, low-cost operating environment
  provided by the IC.
</p>
<p>
  Internet Computer (IC) is currently the world's most advanced smart contract
  container running platform. This achievement is attributed to Dominic
  Williams, the founder and chief scientist of the DFINITY Foundation. He led a
  group of top computer and cryptography experts to conduct years of research,
  providing a strong and reliable foundation for the implementation of Delta.
</p>
<p>
  Internet Computer (hereinafter referred to as IC) realizes the vision of a
  world computer - an open and secure blockchain-based network that can host
  programs and data in the form of smart contracts, and perform calculations on
  smart contracts in a safe and reliable manner. and infinitely expandable. IC
  smart contracts are composable and autonomous software components that run on
  a decentralized blockchain, which makes them unable to be tampered with and
  stopped. IC gets rid of the speed, storage cost and computing power
  limitations of smart contracts on traditional blockchains, allowing the full
  potential of smart contracts to be unleashed. IC allows smart contracts to
  achieve complete decentralization for the first time.
</p>
<p>
  About the Motoko programming language, it is a new, modern, type-safe language
  suitable for building smart contracts for next-generation distributed
  applications to run on the Internet Computer blockchain network. Motoko is
  specifically designed to support the unique features of Internet Computer and
  provide a powerful programming environment and capabilities that are familiar
  to users.

    Festival: In order to enrich spiritual life and promote the communication
    and development of Delta, we need to define a festival. Starting from 2023,
    March 3rd of each year will be defined as Delta's festival. At the same
    time, all Delta transactions generated on that day will be completely exempt
    from transaction fees. This mechanism of free transaction fees will be set
    in the program at the beginning of development.
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>4. The Future</h2>
<h3>4.1 Stablecoin</h3>
<p>
  There is no doubt that sovereign currency is the most popular currency at
  present. We expect Delta to become the mainstream super-sovereign digital
  currency in the world in the future.
  <q id="tⅸ" title="Stablecoin"
    >Stablecoin<a href="#fⅸ"><sup>ⅸ</sup></a></q
  >
  It is an encrypted digital currency that always keeps the same price as the
  sovereign currency. This means that, from the perspective of value, it can be
  directly used as a substitute for the current fiat currency transaction
  scenario. A reliable stablecoin is a bridge between non-sovereign currency and
  sovereign currency. We plan to design a universal stablecoin that allows
  ordinary people to participate in the minting and operation, which will
  completely lead to the prevalence of non-sovereign digital currencies in the
  future. We will strive to establish such a stablecoin based on Delta in the
  subsequent community discussions and opinion collection process.
</p>

<h3>4.2 Open Source approach</h3>
<p>
  In order to ensure the transparency, fairness and openness of the system, and
  to gain the support of the wider community and become a common currency system
  for all mankind, Delta's open source will be imperative. The entire Delta
  system needs to consist of multiple parts and multiple software projects,
  which need to run in different environments, such as running on the Internet
  as a server, running on Android or IOS devices as a client, or in the form of
  a web. In order to protect the Delta ecosystem and prevent the abuse of source
  code, we will gradually open source some software projects according to
  development needs. It is expected that when the total number of users reaches
  1/30 of the world's total population, we will be completely open source.
</p>
<h3>4.3 Governance and Upgrades</h3>
<p>
  In order to establish a lasting governance model and find a balance between
  efficiency and fairness, Delta will adopt a two-stage plan.
</p>
<h4>4.3.1 Interim governance model</h4>
<p>
  Before the system is open sourced, a "interim governance model" will be
  adopted, similar to the current mainstream "off-chain" governance model. In
  this model, core developers play a very important role in system development
  and direction. Delta will first launch a "roadmap" subroutine, and developers
  will first publish the completed parts, ongoing parts, and planned development
  parts in the "roadmap". In addition, the "Roadmap" subroutine will also have
  suggestions and voting functions, through which any member of the Delta
  community can provide feedback and make suggestions. Finally, core developers
  will further update the roadmap based on these comments and suggestions. This
  model ensures efficiency and openness, but relies heavily on core developers
  for impartiality and durability.
</p>
<h4>4.3.2 DAO mode</h4>
<p>
  After the system is fully open source, it will adopt the "Decentralized
  Autonomous Organization (DAO) model". Under the DAO model, Delta will
  establish a "governance committee" and a "developer committee" based on voting
  by all users, and rely on a service nervous system (SNS). Members of the
  governance committee will publish and vote on proposals through this SNS
  system, and the proposals that are finally voted on will be taken over by
  members of the "Developer Committee" and develop the proposal. After the
  implementation is completed, it will be submitted to the "Developer Committee"
  for review and voting. After the vote is passed, SNS will execute the release
  of the new version of the program. The execution flow of this process will be
  controlled by SNS. In addition, a “Governance and Developer Reward Fund” will
  be established to reward governors and developers who invest time and energy
  into Delta. The cost of the "Governance and Developer Reward Fund" mainly
  comes from part of the newly issued quota after the transaction fees are
  burned and the remaining part of the original "Ecological Construction Reward
  Fund".
</p>
<p>
  Formally, in order to increase people's attention to each upgrade and express
  the importance of each upgrade, Delta will adopt a naming method related to
  global rivers to name each major version upgrade. Specifically, Delta will use
  the names of the top 100 rivers in the world in terms of river length, in
  order, as the version names of each major upgrade. This plan was adopted from
  the geographical term "Delta", which happens to refer to the triangular plain
  area impacting the mouth of a large river downstream of the sea.

<h4>4.3.3 Proposal Type</h4>
<p>
  In the DAO mode, the operating parameters and upgrades of the system are
  mainly improved through proposals. We divide the main types of proposals into
  annual proposals and daily proposals.
</p>
<p>
  Annual Proposal: represents a proposal that can only be modified and executed
  once a year. In order to give this process a more ceremonial feeling, we
  decided to execute the annual proposal on Delta’s holiday (March 3). Usually,
  the annual proposal involves the modification of system parameters that have a
  wide impact, such as the modification of transaction fees.
</p>
<p>
  Daily proposals: proposals other than the general annual proposals are daily
  proposals.

<h2>at last:</h2>
<p>
  The design and creation of Delta did not come out of nowhere. Delta is the
  result of standing on the shoulders of countless currency revolutionaries and
  shouters, drawing on their wisdom and summarizing their experiences. Delta's
  inspiration mainly comes from "Denationalization of Currency", "Bitcoin",
  "Ethereum", "Internet Computer", "Pi White Paper" and other related books,
  documents, and projects. Here are some comments on " Friedrich Hayek ",
  "Satoshi Nakamoto", "Vitalik Buterin", "Dominic Williams", " Nicolas Kokalis"
  and Fan Enlightenment Couple" and other authors expressed their thanks. At the
  same time, I would also like to thank everyone who has acted and contributed
  in the field of blockchain and non-sovereign currency. Thank you all.
